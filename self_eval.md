# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I'm most proud of just overcoming some of the challenges I faced, particularly with methods. I definitely want to practice and learn more about them!
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

Methods let you easily perform complex actions repeatedly without having to rewrite the code every time, potentially making the entire project more efficient, easier to understand and easier to write.
